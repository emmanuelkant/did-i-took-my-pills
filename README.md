# üíä Never forgot about your pills

I have created this project to help people like me to remember if they took their pills or not. Just the clock alarm is not enough for me, after 3 hours I didn't remember if I took my pills or not. Here you can simply click on a button and then if you forgot if you took or not your pills, just consult the app and see the info.

It is important to say that the app just works for those pills you need to take every day at the same time, in other words, one pill or pills every 24 hours.

I hope you like it.
